## HOMEWORK

1. What's the difference between a property (prop) and state?  Why would you use one over the other?

2. What is the difference between a container componentand a presentational component?  What is the advantage of structuring your components this way?

For the remaining questions, create a branch off lesson1 and use it for the modifications.

3. Modify the application so that items can be toggled back and forth between done and not done. (At present once an item is marked done it cannot be "undone".)

4. Modify the application so that when an item is marked done, the date on which it was marked done is listed to the right of the item in the item list.

5. Modify the application so that when there are no items, a message telling you that is shown (instead of simply showing nothing).

6. Change the application such that _all_ state is maintained in the TodosApp component.

7. Add functionality to allow the user to sort the items by name, completion status (done or not done), or completion date.  You may want to change the presentation so that items are listed in a table when you do so, with clickable header columns.  (Think of any other components you might want to introduce to make this easier.)
